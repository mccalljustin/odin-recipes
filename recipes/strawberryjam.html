    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Peanut butter sandwich sauce. Like f'real, you aren't going to find a better supplement to that <em>creamy</em> 
            peanut butter sloshed on that <strong>strong</strong> Trader Joe's wheat slice.
        </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
            <li>4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Strangle your strawberries in the most vicious manner. Get as much of the strawberry 
                off your hand as possible into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Gently mix the strawberry slush with the sugar and lemon juice in a <strong>HEAVY BOTTOMED SAUCEPAN ok</strong>
             and stir over <em>low</em> heat until sugar evaporates?</li>
            <li>Increase heat until it hurts your hand and bring the mixture to a, and this is important now, 
                <strong>FULL <em>ROLLING</em> BOIL.</strong> Boil, stirring endlessly, until mixture reaches dangerous temps.</li>
            <li>Transfer to hot! sterile! jars! leaving a thumbnail (width) for headspace and <em>seal!</em>.</li>
            <li>Because the jam will be eaten right away (due to its <em>irresistibility</em>) don't bother with processing (in a water bath?)
             and just <strong><em>refrigerate!</em></strong></li>
        </ol>
